========================================================================
THE FOLLOWING ARE INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE YOUR OWN VALUES FOR GAME DATA |
========================================================================
Please note that each respective file has sample data included to aid
you in writing your own data.

=======
CLUES |
=======
  * Clues must be written in 'clues.txt,' located in the folder containing 
    these instructions.

  * Clues must be separated in these files by one or more blank lines.
      -This means there cannot be any blank lines within a single clue.
      -For easiest viewing, separate clues in the same category by one line, 
       and categories by several.
  
  * There are sample clues already in 'clues.txt' to guide you. 
    To create your own clues, replace the sample data with your own text, 
    taking note of the following:
      
      - Clues are written starting from the top left clue box, then by column.
         ~ Example: On a 5x5 board, the first 5 clues will be the clues for 
           the leftmost category, starting at the top. The next 5 will be for 
           the column to the right, starting at the top.
      
      - Clues can be any length, but abnormally long clues may be too small
        to be easily read.

      - As can be seen in the sample clues, you may choose to write an
        entire clue on a single line or dictate the line breaks
        yourself. The simplest method is to write each clue on a single
        line.


============
CATEGORIES |
============
  * Categories must be written in 'categories.txt,' located in the folder 
    containing these instructions.

  * Each non-empty line in 'categories.txt' is treated as a category. 
    Replace the sample categories with your own.

  * The capitalization used in 'categories.txt' will be used in the game 
    (all caps is recommended).

  * Leading or trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, returns) is ignored.

  * Category names can be any length/any number of words, but shorter
    is better for readability.


==============
PLAYER NAMES |
==============
  * Player names are defined in 'players.txt,' located in the folder 
    containing these instructions.

  * Each player/team name must be on a separate line.

  * There is a maximum of 3 players/teams at this time. If more names 
    are provided in the file, they will be ignored, and a warning message 
    printed. If there are fewer than 3 names provided, default names 
    (Player 1, etc...) will be used for missing names.

  * Leading or trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, returns) is ignored.

  * Names can be any length and any number of words, but keep in mind very
    long names may be drawn so small as to be essentially unreadable.


=========
AMOUNTS |
=========
  * Clue amounts are defined in 'amounts.txt,' located in the folder 
    containing these instructions.

  * Each amount should be on a separate line, and must be only an integer 
    (ex: 200).
  
  * Do not include a dollar sign, decimal or any other non-numeric character.

  * Make sure the number of amounts matches the number of clues per category.

  * Amounts can be arbitrarily high, but note that scores of 10 million or higher 
    will not fit properly on the podia. There are no plans to change this behavior 
    as it is considered an extreme edge case.


=======
RULES |
=======
  * Rules are defined in 'rules.txt,' located in the folder containing 
    these instructions.

  * Rules are displayed after the opening sequence, before the category 
    scroll.

  * Each rule should be on a separate line.

  * Leading or trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, returns) is ignored.

  * It is recommended to start each rule with a bullet-like character, such as 
    an asterisk (*).


==========
SUBTITLE |
==========
  * Subtitle must be written in 'subtitle.txt,' located in the folder 
    containing these instructions.

  * The first line in 'subtitle.txt' containing any non-whitespace text 
    is treated as the subtitle.

  * If no subtitle is desired, make 'subtitle.txt' empty (do not delete it, 
    however).
