the cad models contained in this folder are used to hold a broken out 4 pin gpio pin header
the relevant pins connect to rj11 keystone terminals along with 3.3 volt power, and 12 volt positive and minus connections
the 12 volt wires are used to power the light in the buttons for the contestants. 
the standard connection for the rj11 cabling has the gpio and 3.3 volts in the center of the cable
the 12 volt connection is consistantly connected to the outside conductors on the keystone jack. 
On both sides it is important that the 12 volt positive and minus are consistant to ensure lights in the buttons are hooked up correctly. 
the 12 volt adapter is held in place using hot glue. 
the gpio used for the 5 terminals currently conencted are as follows
gpio 4 is connected to player 1
gpio 17 is connected to player 2
gpio 27 is connected to player 3
gpio 22 is connected to player 4
gpio 5 is connceted to player 5

currently the game does not have code that supports 5 players though this is in the works so support was added for that expansion

Attached files for breakout box are "breakout box lid" and "breakout box base" 
included are 3MF, STL and STEP files for easier use with slicing software or to add your own modifications using cad software (STEP file)

Also attached are several images of the breakout box exterior as a completed unit

Button box models will be included as well in a future update. these are files used for lazer cutting.
