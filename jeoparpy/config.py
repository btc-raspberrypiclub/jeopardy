#=================
#
# SET DISPLAY RESOLUTION BELOW. Resolution must have a widescreen
# (16:9 or 16:10) aspect ratio.
#
# Common 16:9 resolutions:
# (1024, 576), (1280, 720), (1366, 768), (1600, 900), (1920, 1080)
#
# Common 16:10 resolutions:
# (1280, 800), (1440, 900), (1680, 1050), (1920, 1200)
#
# It is not recommended to use a resolution higher than (1920, 1200).
SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H = SCREEN_SIZE = (1024, 576)

# This setting controls whether the game is run in fullscreen or windowed
# mode. (1 for fullscreen, 0 for windowed).
#
# It is recommended to run the game with FULLSCREEN = 1
# FULLSCREEN is 0 by default in case the default resolution is not supported.
#
# Invoking start.py with a -f, --fullscreen, -w, or --windowed option
# will override this setting.

# This is the time in miliseconds after which a clue will timeout
# if no player has buzzed in. This field should be an integer.
# The default value is 20 seconds.
#
# If a clue has an audio reading, the timer begins immediately after
# the reading finishes. If the clue has other attached audio, the timer is 
# not triggered at all. This is to prevent problems with audio being longer
# than the time provided.
#
# If the value is 0, negative, or None, the timer will be disabled for the
# entire game.
